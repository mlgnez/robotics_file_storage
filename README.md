# FRC 5431 File Storage

A File storage program that allows users to connect to a website, and upload and download files from the host computer. Made using the Server version of Blazor, users can connect to the website and upload files from their computer to the hosts computer, by uploading the file to a folder. You can also download these files, by clicking the "List Files" button, which will display all files in the folder. You can download a file by clicking on it. You can select whether you want to download the files to the host computer (please use this) or, if you would like to use the google drive api.

This is meant and developed for FRC-5431's marketing team as their google drive is overflowing.
