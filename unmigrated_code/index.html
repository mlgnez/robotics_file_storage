        <h2>File Storage Type</h2>
        <p1>You get to choose what type of storage technique use are
        using.<br />
        Just remember, what files show up when you press “Load Files”<br />
        depends on what type you are using.<br /></p1>

          <h3>Default Storage</h3>
          <p1
            >Storage amount: 500 Gigabytes<br /><br />

            A Hard drive that is on the computer. While google<br />
            drive has cloud back-ups and easy accessibility,<br />
            this has much more storage and is a faster drive.<br />
          </p1>

        <div class="gstore">
          <h3>Google drive</h3>
          <p1
            >Storage amount: 45 Gigabytes (More can be added)<br /><br />

            This is a lot slower than the Hard Drive, but will<br />
            have the accessiblity and back-ups from google.<br />
            Less storage, but more secure.<br
